            <h3>Brief History:</h3>

            <article>
              <p>
                The School is located at Ntowkrom, a village in Ayensuano
                District in the Eastern region of Ghana. It was started as a
                private primary school by a native of the village called Opanyin
                Ansah. It was absorbed by the government (Ghana Education
                Service) in 1956.
              </p>

              <p>
                It was first called Sunsumamu L/A Primary and later in 2010, the
                name was changed to Ntowkrom D/A Primary. The Junior High School
                department was started in 2014 and the school became known as
                Ntowkrom D/A Basic.
